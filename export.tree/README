this dataset contains the data of 3 subjects performing a retinotopic mapping experiment, using the population receptive field (pRF) method. Parts of this dataset were published in Current Biology in 2019, (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2019.04.012) and Cerebral Cortex in 2020 (https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz323)

Each subject performed 3 or 4 sessions, totalling up to 43 three-minute runs. The stimulus design and pRF analysis code are available at https://github.com/daanvanes/cerebellum_prf

The visual design matrix for pRF analyses can be found at https://osf.io/5bmdn/
